# GrocerySaver
GrocerySaver is an innovative app that addresses the issue of food waste and helps users save money by optimizing their grocery shopping and meal planning.

##Inspiration
I love cooking, and as I'm preparing to move abroad, I've realized how important it is to be mindful of what I have in my pantry and how I plan my meals. Moving to a new country often comes with challenges like managing a new budget, adapting to local grocery stores, and avoiding waste due to unfamiliarity with food availability and pricing. I wanted an app that could help me efficiently manage my groceries, reduce waste, and make meal planning easier, especially as I adjust to a new environment. That’s where the idea for GrocerySaver was born.

##What it does
GrocerySaver is a mobile app designed to help users manage their pantry, plan meals, and reduce food waste. It allows users to track the items they have on hand, receive recipe suggestions based on available ingredients, and generate shopping lists for missing items. The app also syncs with local grocery stores to provide discounts on items nearing their expiration dates, ensuring users can save money while minimizing waste. With features like expiration date alerts, smart shopping lists, and customizable meal plans, GrocerySaver makes meal preparation and grocery shopping more efficient and sustainable.

##How we built it
We built GrocerySaver using React Native for the front-end to ensure cross-platform compatibility, allowing the app to be accessible on both iOS and Android devices. The back-end is powered by Node.js and Express, which handles the API requests and manages user data, pantry inventories, and recipes. We used MongoDB to store all this information efficiently. Additionally, we integrated third-party APIs from grocery stores to provide users with real-time price comparisons and discounts. Basic machine learning algorithms were implemented to improve recipe suggestions based on user preferences and history.

##Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we faced was integrating the app with multiple grocery store APIs, as each store had different data formats and availability. Ensuring that the expiration date alerts were accurate and timely also required careful consideration of how to handle varying product shelf lives. Additionally, designing an intuitive user interface that could handle the complexity of managing a pantry and generating smart shopping lists was a significant challenge. Balancing the feature set to keep the app user-friendly while also providing advanced functionality was another hurdle we had to overcome.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of creating an app that not only solves a real-life problem but does so in a way that’s accessible and easy to use. Successfully integrating local store discounts to help users save money was a significant achievement, as was developing an algorithm that suggests recipes based on what’s already in the pantry. The positive feedback from initial user testing, especially from those who, like me, are preparing to move or have just moved, has been incredibly rewarding.

##What we learned
Throughout the development of GrocerySaver, we learned a lot about the complexities of food management and the potential of technology to address everyday challenges. We gained insights into API integration, user experience design, and how to leverage machine learning for personalized user experiences. We also learned the importance of balancing functionality with simplicity to create an app that meets user needs without overwhelming them.

##What's next for GrocerySaver
The next steps for GrocerySaver include expanding the app’s database of recipes and grocery stores, incorporating more advanced meal planning features, and improving the machine learning algorithms for even better recipe recommendations. We’re also planning to introduce a community feature where users can share their recipes and meal plans with others. Additionally, we aim to explore partnerships with more grocery stores to offer even more savings to our users. As the app evolves, we hope to make it a go-to resource for anyone looking to manage their groceries and meal planning more effectively, no matter where they are in the world.
